            <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures
                and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming.</p>
            <p>Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal
                language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms</p>
            <p>The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or
                other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable
                applications.</p>

            <header>Python and JS</header>
            <p>There isn't much of a distinction between Python and JavaScript. Because both Python and JavaScript share
                features like lexically scoped, object-oriented, interpreted, functional, and imperative programming,
                you can do practically anything with them. If a language lacks functionality, we have a plethora of
                existing libraries and extensions to help us get what we need.</p>
            <p>Simplilearn’s comprehensive Post Graduate Program in Full Stack Web Development will teach you the basics
                of Python. This certification course will give you hands-on development experience and prepare you for
                an exciting career as a professional Python programmer.</p>

            <p>Python variables are the reserved memory locations used to store values with in a Python Program.
            <p>This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in the memory.</p>

        </section> <br />
        <section class='main-section' id='Variable_Assignment'>
            <header>Variable Assignment</header>
            <p>Based on the data type of a variable, Python interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored
                in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to Python variables, you can store
                integers, decimals or characters in these variables.</p>
            <p>Think of a variable as a name attached to a particular object. In Python, variables need not be declared
                or defined in advance, as is the case in many other programming languages. To create a variable, you
                just assign it a value and then start using it. Assignment is done with a single equals sign (=):</p>
            <code>>>> n = 300</code>
            <p>This is read or interpreted as “n is assigned the value 300.” Once this is done, n can be used in a
                statement or expression, and its value will be substituted:</p>
            <code>>>> print(n)
                300</code>
            <p>Python also allows chained assignment, which makes it possible to assign the same value to several
                variables simultaneously:</p>
            <code>>>> a = b = c = 300<br />
                >>> print(a, b, c)
                300 300 300
            </code>
        </section> <br />


        <section class='main-section' id='Variable_Types'>
            <header>Variable Types</header>
            <p>In many programming languages, variables are statically typed. That means a variable is initially
                declared to have a specific data type, and any value assigned to it during its lifetime must always have
                that type.</p>
            <p>Variables in Python are not subject to this restriction. In Python, a variable may be assigned a value of
                one type and then later re-assigned a value of a different type:</p>
            <code>>>> var = 23.5<br />
                >>> print(var)
                23.5<br />
                >>> var = "Now I'm a string"<br />
                >>> print(var)
                Now I'm a string</code>

        <section class='main-section' id='Function'>
            <header>Function</header>
            <p>A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action.
                Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.</p>
            <p>As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like print(), etc. but you can also create
                your own functions. These functions are called user-defined functions.</p>
        </section> <br />

        <section class='main-section' id='Defining_a_Function'>
            <header>Defining a Function
            </header>
            <p>You can define functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules to define a
                function in Python.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Function blocks begin with the keyword def followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ).

                </li>
                <li>Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define
                    parameters inside these parentheses.

                </li>
                <li>The first statement of a function can be an optional statement - the documentation string of the
                    function or docstring.

                </li>
                <li>The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.

                </li>
                <li>The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the
                    caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example</p>
            <code>def functionname( parameters ):<br />
                "function_docstring"<br />
                function_suite<br />
                return [expression]</code><br />
